Project for the class NPRG005 of MFF UK

---

Whole project is managed with the CABAL tool.

The only way to easily run it, is to clone the repository and run `cabal run`.

The project provides a simple text user interface, which will guide the user through the game.

May users be warned, that the app currently doesn't support move validation, so behaviour after any illegal moves is undefined.
