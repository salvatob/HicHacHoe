#### HicHacHoe - A simple tictactoe program written in the Haskell programming language
##### Project for the class NPRG005 of MFF UK

---

Whole project is managed with the CABAL tool.

The only way to easily run it, is to clone the repository and run `cabal run`.

The project provides a simple text user interface, which will guide the user through the game.

User can choose between two games. Simple 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe, or Connect 5 (also called gomoku) on an infinite grid.

May users be warned, that the app currently doesn't support move validation, so behaviour after any illegal moves is undefined.
